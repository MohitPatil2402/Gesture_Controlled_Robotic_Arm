# Gesture_Controlled_Robotic_Arm
# 🤖 Robotic_Pro – Hand Gesture Controlled Robot

This project implements a **gesture-controlled robotic system** using **Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe**.  
The robot is controlled through hand gestures captured by a webcam, and commands are sent via **UDP** to an **ESP8266** module for execution.

---

## 📌 Features
- ✋ Detects hand gestures using **MediaPipe Hands**  
- 🎮 Supports multiple commands:  
  - `FORWARD`, `BACKWARD`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `UP`, `DOWN`  
  - `GRAB`, `RELEASE`, `STOP`  
- 📡 Sends commands to ESP8266 over **UDP protocol**  
- 🖥️ Real-time gesture visualization with OpenCV  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3.x**
- **OpenCV**
- **MediaPipe**
- **ESP8266** (for UDP communication)
